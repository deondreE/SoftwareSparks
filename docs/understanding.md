## Current State of Software Sparks

Currently, Software Sparks is still an idea that I've had to make a Code Editing Expirence availible to all platforms and all people.
But, what does that mean, and how does it work? Well, I'll explain that in the next section.

## Understanding Software Sparks

Creating a Code Editing Expirence avialible to all people and platforms:
    1. Figure out the most widley used platform and start there 
        - Websites
        - Macos applications
        - Windows applications
        - Linux applications
        - Android applications
        - Ios applications
    2. Figure out how to make the bundle size (or load time) of the website fast and repsponsive
    3. Figure out how to make the application fast and responsive
    4. Create an identical user expirence to having a code editor on your computer
        - Customizability
        - Code Completion
        - Extensions
        - File Structure
        - Support for all languages
        - Support for all platforms
        - Ability to Upload to NPM, yarn, and other package managers
        - Ability to run code -- by yourself without autocompletion
            - fast realtime response
            - ability to run code in the background 
        - Ability to customize the Terminal:
            - Ability to change the terminal theme
            - Ability to change the terminal font
            - Ability to change the terminal font size
            - Ability to change the terminal font color
            - Ability to change the terminal background color
            - Ex: [ ] Dark Mode 
    5. Understand how people learn code the fastest and offer classes to teach them
    6. Create a platform for teachers to teach their students
    7. Create a platform for students to learn code
